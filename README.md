<img width="1858" height="392" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-04 173954" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db7af716-cbac-4f5d-aea1-43b1cc139b5d" />

 
**Conclusion:**
The data highlights two types of opportunities:
Steady-demand categories (Apparel, Home, Grocery, Laptops) → ideal for long-term growth and consistent campaigns.
Seasonal-demand categories (Toys, Pet Supplies, Sports, Speakers) → best leveraged with targeted promotions during peak months to maximize sales impact.



## Question 2:How does the search trend (popularity) for smartphones fluctuate throughout the year? Is there a seasonal pattern?
```
Convert to datetime:
df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'], errors='coerce')
Create weekly grouping:
df['Week'] = df['date'].dt.to_period('W').apply(lambda r: r.start_time)
Weekly average trends:
weekly_trends = df.groupby('Week')['Trend'].mean().reset_index()
```
Smartphone searches peak sharply in September and July, aligning with festive and summer sale seasons.
There is a noticeable dip in November–December, followed by steady moderate interest in early 2025.
Overall, the data shows a clear seasonal pattern, with demand surging around major sales and promotional events.

**Conclusion:**
The order distribution shows that Grocery and Electronics dominate customer demand, making them key drivers of sales. Businesses should prioritize inventory, faster delivery, and promotions in these categories,
while exploring strategies to boost engagement in low-order segments like Pet Supplies and Outdoors.


## Question 5: How does traffic condition affect the average delivery time?
```
Calculate average delivery time for each traffic condition:
traffic_delivery = df.groupby('Traffic')['Delivery_Time'].mean().sort_values(ascending=False)
```
Delivery times are significantly impacted by traffic conditions.
Orders delivered during “Jam” traffic take the longest (≈121 mins), followed by High (≈119 mins), Medium (≈115 mins), and Low traffic (≈98 mins).
This confirms the intuitive understanding that worse traffic leads to longer delivery durations.
<img width="2967" height="1768" alt="barchart" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d68b4a7a-8ac5-4323-80ef-844c7bd3885c" />

**Conclusion:**
Traffic congestion is a major driver of delivery delays, with “Jam” conditions adding over 20 minutes compared to low-traffic periods. 
Businesses can improve efficiency by adjusting delivery schedules, using real-time traffic data, and optimizing routes to minimize delays during peak traffic hours.

## Question 6: Which vehicle type is most frequently used for deliveries, and how does it perform on average?  
```
Plot 1: Count of orders by vehicle type
vehicle_count = df['Vehicle'].value_counts()
Plot 2: Average delivery time by vehicle type
vehicle_delivery = df.groupby('Vehicle')['Delivery_Time'].mean().sort_values(ascending=False)
```
The motorcycle is the most frequently used delivery vehicle, handling 19,242 orders, making it the backbone of delivery operations.
Scooters come next with 11,983 orders, while vans are the least used with 2,855 orders.
In terms of delivery time:
Scooters are the fastest (≈ 106.8 minutes).
Vans take the longest (≈ 166.4 minutes).

<img width="1727" height="579" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-04 183511" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5f21ef8-d64c-4bad-8d36-5007a9beb073" />

**Conclusion:**
Motorcycles dominate deliveries due to their balance of speed and capacity, but scooters are the most time-efficient option for urban routes. Vans, while slower, are essential for bulk or long-distance deliveries. 
Businesses should optimize fleet allocation by using scooters for high-density urban areas, motorcycles for general deliveries, and vans for large-volume or specialized orders.
Motorcycles fall in between (≈ 113.2 minutes).

## Question 7:  What is the financial impact of payment failures, and which failure categories contribute most to revenue loss?  
```
Calculate financial impact of failures
rbi_df['upi_failed_transactions'] = rbi_df['total_transactions'] * 0.6 * (rbi_df['upi_failure_rate'] / 100)
rbi_df['card_failed_transactions'] = rbi_df['total_transactions'] * 0.3 * (rbi_df['card_failure_rate'] / 100)
rbi_df['netbanking_failed_transactions'] = rbi_df['total_transactions'] * 0.1 * (rbi_df['netbanking_failure_rate'] / 100)

Assuming average transaction value of ₹1500 for financial impact calculation
avg_transaction_value = 1500
rbi_df['upi_financial_impact'] = rbi_df['upi_failed_transactions'] * avg_transaction_value
rbi_df['card_financial_impact'] = rbi_df['card_failed_transactions'] * avg_transaction_value
rbi_df['netbanking_financial_impact'] = rbi_df['netbanking_failed_transactions'] * avg_transaction_value
rbi_df['total_financial_impact'] = (rbi_df['upi_financial_impact'] + 
                                   rbi_df['card_financial_impact'] + 
                                   rbi_df['netbanking_financial_impact'])
Create visualization
fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(15, 6))
```
Failure Rate Trends:
Net Banking: Highest failure rates (3.9–4.5%).
Card Payments: Moderate failure rates (3.2–3.8%).
UPI: Lowest but rising failure rates (1.8–2.3%).

**Financial Impact:**
UPI failures cause the largest financial loss due to its massive transaction volume, despite lower failure rates.
Estimated losses: ₹1,894 crores (Jan) → ₹2,362 crores (Mar).
Total financial loss for Q1 (Jan–Mar 2024): ~₹6,400 crores.

**Business Implications:**
UPI should be the primary focus since even a 0.5% reduction in failures could save ₹400–500 crores monthly.
Card failures disproportionately affect premium customers and high-value orders.
Net Banking needs integration improvements to lower failure rates.

**Recommendations:**
Enhance UPI monitoring and add automatic retry/fallback mechanisms.
Provide seamless switch options to alternate payment modes on failure.
Strengthen bank integrations for Net Banking.
Deploy real-time failure alerting to reduce downtime impact.
